# Facilitating powerpoint karaoke
## What you need
A computer with internet access, connected to a TV screen or projector. 

Open up several tabs on the computer with the chosen slides from [list-of-links.html](https://github.com/abisola/powerpoint-karaoke/blob/master/list-of-links.html)

A 3-minute countdown timer

## Step 1. Prepare topics for presenters

*Option 1:*  Prepare topics beforehand. Write one topic per post-it note and squish into a bag. Topics can be as random as they come. Example topics: marshmallows should be blue, thereâ€™s no `i` in team, hot coffee in the desert, etc.

*Option 2:* Invite participants to spend 3-4 minutes producing topics (one topic per post-it note). Collect topics and squish into a bag.

## Step 2. Running a session
Invite a volunteer to come forward and pick one of the post-its from the bag and read the topic. Give them about 5 seconds to reflect on the topic and then click on a random tab to start the presentation.

You will be flicking the slides for the presenter *at your own pace* (10-20 seconds per slide should be okay).

Continue for about 3 minutes.

## Step 3. Invite next presenter
